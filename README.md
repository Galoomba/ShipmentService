### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for running app containers.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Package manager (" To run unit tests outside the docker container").
- [tsc](https://www.typescriptlang.org) for compiling typescript files to javascript.
- [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) for running typescript files while development.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

- Running locale <br>
  we have two ways to run the project locally.
  - Using ts_node <br>
    --> Install ts_node<br>
    --> run `npm install` for installing app dependance<br>
    --> run `npm run test` to test project components<br>
    --> run `npm start` to run project <br>
  - Using tsc
    -->Install tsc<br>
    --> run `npm run build` to build the dist folder<br>
    --> run `node ./dist/index.js` to start the built files<br>
    --> or start the project using pm2 by using `npm run deploy` command.
- Running using Docker <br>
  - building the image<br>
    --> run `docker build -t shipment:v1` .<br>
    --> run `docker run -p 3001:3001 shipment:v1`.<br>
  - pull the image from docker hub<br>
    --> run `docker pull galoomba12/shipmentservice:v1` .<br>
    --> run `docker run -p 3001:3001 galoomba12/shipmentservice:v1`.<br>

### Request flow

`Router` receiving the request and passing it to the -> `Controller`<br>
`Controller` Constructor is returning a proxy that get triggered before every controller function invocation. <br>
`Container Proxy` -> invokes the `Shipment Factory` dynamically before every method call and bind a shipment object to the controller method based on the shipment type.<br>
`Service Factory` -> loads an instance of the shipment classes based on the shipment type from the `ShipmentTypeEnum` If the `Service Factory` Fails to load the shipment type it throws `TypeNotFoundException` exception<br><br><br>

A shipment Object will be passed to the controller method params, Then the controller method init the `Validator Factory` sending the ` shipment object` as a param to it's constructor.<br>
Based on the Object that is based to the Factory it will return a validator class that should contain the validation logic on it's `Validate` method.<br>

The `Validation Class` will retrieve the `service rules` and the `data object` in order to validate wither the data object is corrupted or not.<br>
If any of the rules is being violated it will populate the errors array with the violation and throw a `CorruptedObjectException` exception <br><br><br>

If the object passes the validation checks, the shipment ` save ()` method is invoked and a 200 status code response is send.<br>

If any exception where thrown during request life cycle, It will be passed to the `Error Handler` which will map the error response and send it back.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

The project is using ts-mocha to run the test cases.

- run `npm test`

```
  Shipment
    Shipment Factory
      ‚úî Should return instance of Shipment Class  according to shipment type
      ‚úî Should return instance of Shipment Class  according to shipment type x2
      ‚úî Should not return instance of other shipment type class
      ‚úî Should throw exception incase of  not found
      Factory instance data Object
        ‚úî Should has the same data object send to factory
    Shipment Classes save logic
      ‚úî Should console log UPS saved!
      ‚úî Should console log Fedex saved!

  Shipment Validation
    Validation Factory
      ‚úî Should return instance of UPS Validator
      ‚úî Should return instance of Fedex Validator
      ‚úî Should return return void as object rules are not violated
    Validation classes exceptions
      Validate Fedex data object
        ‚úî Should throw exception of type CorruptedObjectException
        ‚úî Should throw exception of type CorruptedObjectException
        ‚úî Should throw exception of type CorruptedObjectException
      Validate UPS data object
        ‚úî Should throw exception of type CorruptedObjectException
        ‚úî Should throw exception of type CorruptedObjectException
        ‚úî Should throw exception of type CorruptedObjectException

#### Note: before you run and test make sure that you install all the dependance `npm install`
